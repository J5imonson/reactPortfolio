# React Portfolio

### For this assignment, we were tasked with making a personal portfolio using React. Please note, I made a critical error when I initiated this project, which forced me to move my project and force push my complete project into this repository. This is why I have no commit history. I can assure you this is all origional work, which is backed up by the fact that all of the contents of this project are also my work.

          I was a chef for the last decade, but after my son was born, I wanted to be at home more with my growing family. After looking into a dozen different fields of employment, I landed on coding. I have always been interested in technology, but decided to pursue my culinary interests first. So, I dusted off my laptop and set out on a new path. I am eager to learn more about this field, and I can't wait to work with you!
